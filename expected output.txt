When everything is correct:
On starting the simulation:
All traffic lights should be RED (via allRed() in setup())
No buzzer sounds
Then each direction gets GREEN → YELLOW → RED in sequence
If you press the pedestrian button:
Pedestrian green LED turns on
Buzzer beeps for a few seconds
If you press the emergency button:
Direction A immediately turns GREEN
Buzzer sounds at higher pitch
